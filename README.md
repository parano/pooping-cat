**Pooping Cat** is the first digital prototype we made for our capstone project. After a number of iterations with our paper prototype, we build this HTML5 based game as part of a "wizard of oz" prototype for our first session of user testing.

It turned out that this initial design is too difficult for our target user group to understand.  The rules are complicated for them and the competitive game mechanism made the experience even worse. We learned a lot form this prototype and the user testing, **later iteration of this game can be found here:** [(=①ω①=)](https://github.com/parano/CritterSafari)
